# Keep It Down

Volume tuning mod for Lethal Company. Supports a wide range of sounds.

### To get the ingame UI, please install [LethalConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AinaVT/LethalConfig/) or [LethalSettings](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/willis81808/LethalSettings/)!
 _(or both if you're feeling spicy)_ LethalConfig is more widely supported and has a nicer interface, but LethalSettings has more features.
